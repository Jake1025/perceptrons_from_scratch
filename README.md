## Perceptron From Scratch

### Introdction

This is my custom implementation of perceptrons created while following along with Marvin L. Minsky's 1988 book Perceptrons.

### Architecture

The main perceptron.py script holds the core logic for the neural network. In the notebooks folder you will find implementations of that logic covering a variety of concepts mentioned in the book.
